# Hello-World
Isn't this how we start everything new in programming? ;p

Hi, I am Uttam.
I just completed my Highschool and am just wandering around with the winds. I have some knowledge of C++, SQL, Networking and hardware(Basic) from school time and I am educating myself on Python and at Programming better.
I look forward to contributing to the open source community and calling it my home. :)
